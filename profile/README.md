## ‚ùì What is Mirror for Sony TV?

**Mirror for Sony TV** is a Mac app that wirelessly mirrors your screen, apps, and media to **Sony BRAVIA / Android TV** without cables, adapters, or set-top boxes. It discovers compatible TVs on your network and streams your desktop in real time‚Äîgreat for movies, slides, Zoom calls, demos, and classroom or meeting room displays.

The app focuses on **stability and picture quality**. You can match your TV‚Äôs resolution, pick the preferred **frame rate**, scale the image, and choose between performance- or quality-oriented encoding. Audio is handled automatically (system, app, or microphone), and a short buffer smooths out Wi-Fi hiccups so playback stays steady.

It‚Äôs also a capable **media caster**: drop video files (MP4/MKV/MOV), choose audio/subtitle tracks, and play them directly on the TV‚Äîno transcoding headaches. For long sessions, you can pin the control panel, mute your Mac, dim the display, and keep the lid closed on supported MacBooks. If your TV supports remote control over the network, playback controls (play/pause/seek) work from the app.

Privacy and convenience features include on-screen **mouse/keyboard privacy** (hide cursor, filter notifications), **window-only** mirroring, and per-app audio routing. Whether you‚Äôre relaxing at home, presenting in a small office, or teaching in a lab, Mirror for Sony TV turns your Mac into a **wireless presenter** with a couple of clicks.
